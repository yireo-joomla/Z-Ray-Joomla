This Z-Ray extension for Joomla allows you to troubleshoot various things in Joomla easily: Panels include a quick overview of the Joomla configuration, including request data and parts of Joomla MVC.

The modules panel allows you to check which Joomla modules are loaded, even if they are not visible on screen. 

The panels for events and plugins allow you to see which plugin events are triggered on the current page, and which plugins implement those events. 

**This is a must-have for any Joomla developer!**
